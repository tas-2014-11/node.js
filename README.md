A personal project using Node.js and MongoDB to track virtual
commodities in an online game.  This is really just a CRUD app
with a minimal UI.  The data model is pretty solid, as are the
templates.

I have another Node.js project with a jQuery UI (not uploaded here)
that uses websockets to allow multiple users to drag-and-drop icons
around on a shared map (also for an online game).
